# WHY I MADE THIS

I was tired of information-farming, cookie inducing, virus giving download sites and apps, so I made a simple, no non-sense downloader.

## Notes

- **Quality Limitation**: Downloads are limited to 1080p because higher resolutions (e.g., 4K) require FFmpeg, which isn’t included to keep this a standalone executable.
- **Windows Only**: This executable is built for Windows. For other platforms, you’d need to build it yourself from the source (see below).
